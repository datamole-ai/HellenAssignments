= Online anomaly detection

Implement online anomaly detection algorithm that follows the scikit-learn interface.
This detector is automatically retrained if a concept drift occurs.
The concept drift is detected if the distribution of training data and inference data is different.
To decide whether the distribution has changed, use an appropriate statistical test.

== Requirements

* Let user define which base anomaly detector should be used.

* Expect that data for inference will come as a stream of data samples or stream of batches of data samples.

* Each retrained of the model is logged with logging module.

* Write a short test (using pytest or other testing library).

* Document your code.

== Side note

* The implementation requires several other parameters that have to be set. We want to see how will you handle them.
